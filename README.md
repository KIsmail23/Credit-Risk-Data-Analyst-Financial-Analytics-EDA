# Credit-Risk-Data-Analyst-Financial-Analytics-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Credit Risk Loan Data to uncover borrower risk patterns using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Includes statistical insights, risk segmentation, visualization, and data cleaning for financial decision-making and credit risk assessment.


Role: Credit Risk Data Analyst
Objective: To explore borrower risk patterns, analyze key financial factors, and derive actionable insights to support loan approval and credit risk assessment.

Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world credit loan dataset to understand how demographic, financial, and behavioral factors affect loan approval, interest rates, and default risk.
Through statistical analysis and visual exploration, this project identifies key variables influencing creditworthiness, including income stability, home ownership, employment length, loan-to-income ratio, and loan intent.

🎯 Key Highlights

✔ Identified high-risk borrower profiles based on income utilization, loan grade, and employment history
✔ Detected data anomalies (age > 100, employment length > 60 months) and cleaned for accuracy
✔ Visualized risk patterns via scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots
✔ Used cross-tabulation to evaluate loan approval trends based on home ownership and loan intent
✔ Extracted insights to support loan decision modeling and credit scoring
